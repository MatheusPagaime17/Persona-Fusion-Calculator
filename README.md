Thats a Persona Fusion Calculator for persona 5 royal.
Enjoy it! ​❤️​

Update v1.1: 

°   Added Treasure Demons Logic 
°   I have updated the JSON file, if u see any Persona with wrong arcana, lvl or tag like DLC, let me know!
°   Updates on the FusionChart, just fixed some arcana results, any error let me know.

Update v1.1.1:

°   FusionChart 100% reviewed and Fixed!!!

Update v1.1.2:

°   Added an Autocomplete Field for personas
°   Updated the fusion logic
    ¹   Some of the bugs the were happening, it was because of the fusion logic that basicly was ordering the arcana for the calculation using alphabet order, now each arcana has a number, so always the calculation will see like the fool arcana is the first and the other arcana is the next, always matching the calculation with the fusion chart.
