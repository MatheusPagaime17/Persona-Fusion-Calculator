Update v1.1.1:

°   FusionChart 100% reviewed and Fixed!!!

Update v1.1.2:

°   Added an Autocomplete Field for personas
°   Updated the fusion logic
    ¹   Some of the bugs the were happening, it was because of the fusion logic that basicly was ordering the arcana for the calculation using alphabet order, now each arcana has a number, so always the calculation will see like the fool arcana is the first and the other arcana is the next, always matching the calculation with the fusion chart.

°   Added a menu for future updates
°   Now when you click on the result persona you will be redirected to the wiki of the persona
